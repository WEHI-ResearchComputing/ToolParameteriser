DIA-NN 1.8 (Data-Independent Acquisition by Neural Networks)
Compiled on Jun 28 2021 10:59:57
Current date and time: Wed Nov 16 14:22:57 2022
Logical CPU cores: 56
Thread number set to 2
Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
A spectral library will be generated
Deep learning will be used to generate a new in silico spectral library from peptides provided
N-terminal methionine excision enabled
In silico digest will involve cuts at K*,R*
Existing .quant files will be used
A spectral library will be created from the DIA runs and used to reanalyse them; .quant files will only be saved to disk during the first step
When generating a spectral library, in silico predicted spectra will be retained if deemed more reliable than experimental ones
Fixed-width center of each elution peak will be used for quantification
Interference removal from fragment elution curves disabled
Mass accuracy will be fixed to 1e-05 (MS2) and 1e-05 (MS1)

2 files will be processed
